ARMCI_MPI_ROOT needs to be on a filesystem which is big enough to hold the NWChem source, which means not your home directory on e.g. Jaguar.

mkdir $ARMCI_MPI_ROOT
cd $ARMCI_MPI_ROOT
svn co https://svn.pnl.gov/svn/nwchem nwchem-trunk # requires password if not cached
# wait a very long time
export NWCHEM_TOP=$ARMCI_MPI_ROOT/nwchem-trunk
cd $NWCHEM_TOP/src/tools
./get-tools # requires password if not cached
rm -rf tcgmsg-mpi tcgmsg pario ma LinAlg global ga-4-3 ga++ examples doc config cca armci-portals armci # this is unnecessary clutter
cd ga-dev
mv armci armci-pnnl # or just delete it
svn co https://svn.mcs.anl.gov/repos/armci-mpi/trunk armci-mpi
ln -s armci-mpi armci
cd armci
# if necessary, build latest m4, automake, autoconf, libtool somewhere
./autogen.sh

# at this point, you should be done with the GA/ARMCI part

cd $NWCHEM_TOP/src

# comment out these lines from $NWCHEM_TOP/src/GNUmakefile:
include ./tools/armci/config/makecoms.h  
include ./tools/armci/config/makemp.h  

# choose one of the following, depending on if you are on BGP or not
export NWCHEM_TARGET=LINUX64 
export NWCHEM_TARGET=BGP

# even though ARMCI isn't using a native channel, this variable may have other side effects (NWChem buildsystem FAIL!)
export ARMCI_NETWORK=DCMFMPI
export ARMCI_NETWORK=GEMINI
export ARMCI_NETWORK=OPENIB
export ARMCI_NETWORK=PORTALS

# we only care about SCF, DFT, MP2 and CC
export NWCHEM_MODULES=qm

# must use non-empty options on non-Cray systems, RTFM or just unset BLASOPT to use ultra-slow Netlib
export BLASOPT=" "
