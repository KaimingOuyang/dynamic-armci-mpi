Things that are not yet implemented:

  * build with --enable-strict=c99
  * check local buffers on put/get/acc and perform copy if they are in a shared segment.
  * get rid of copypaste.c - re-implement armci_msg_sel? (NGA_Select_elem)
  * implement armci_read/write_strided?

Things that need performance tuning:

  * Non-blocking operations
  * Strided
  * Vector
