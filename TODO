Things on the to do list:

  * Add function entry checks to make sure ARMCI is initialized (ARMCII_GLOBAL_STATE.initialized)

  * ARMCI Message operations are not shared local buffer safe.  This is high priority.

  * Be less dependent on C99.  Provide non-variadic macro versions of debug and error routines.

  * Verify NWChem on GA on ARMCI-MPI on shared memory.

  * Look into invalid memory references that GA makes on the ghost cells
    examples.

  * Buffer checking: What happens when the target is self and both the
    source and destination buffers are shared.  Is this case handled?
    Can we optimize it with a memcpy?

  * Perform checking to detect ARMCI_Access_begin/end() usage errors.
    * Automatically unlock or re-lock when needed

  * get rid of copypaste.c - re-implement armci_msg_sel? (NGA_Select_elem)

  * Implement remaining functions marked TODO in message.h

Things that need performance tuning:

  * Non-blocking operations
