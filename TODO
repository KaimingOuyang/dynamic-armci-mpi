Things on the to do list:

  * Delete SHR_BUF_METHOD=LOCK

  * Rename ARMCII_Iov_op_onelock to op_batch that takes a batch size.  Replace
    safe with a call to this function.

  * Remove no_bottom.

  * Add a check for MPI_Finalized() anywhere?  Could be expensive.

  * Add function entry checks to make sure ARMCI is initialized
    (ARMCII_GLOBAL_STATE.initialized)

  * ARMCI Message operations are not shared local buffer safe.  This is high
    priority.

  * Be less dependent on C99.  Provide non-variadic macro versions of debug and
    error routines.

  * Look into invalid memory references that GA makes on the ghost cells
    examples.

  * Buffer checking: What happens when the target is self and both the
    source and destination buffers are shared.  Is this case handled?
    Can we optimize it with a memcpy?

  * get rid of copypaste.c - re-implement armci_msg_sel? (NGA_Select_elem)

  * Implement remaining functions marked TODO in message.h

Things that need performance tuning:

  * Non-blocking operations
