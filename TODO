Things on the to do list:

  * Verify NWChem on GA on ARMCI-MPI on shared memory.

  * Look into invalid memory references that GA makes on the ghost cells
    examples.

  * Buffer checking: What happens when the target is self and both the
    source and destination buffers are shared.  Is this case handled?
    Can we optimize it with a memcpy?

  * Perform checking to detect ARMCI_Access_begin/end() usage errors.
    * Detect lock-after-lock, calling Get/Put/Acc in access region.
    * Automatically unlock or re-lock when needed

  * Implement locking changes corresponding to ARMCI access modes.

  * get rid of copypaste.c - re-implement armci_msg_sel? (NGA_Select_elem)

Things that need performance tuning:

  * Non-blocking operations
