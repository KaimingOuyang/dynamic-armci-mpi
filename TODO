Things that are not yet implemented:

  * Perform checking to detect ARMCI_Access_begin/end() usage errors.
    * Detect lock-after-lock, calling Get/Put/Acc in access region.
    * Automatically unlock or re-lock when needed
  * Free all remaining mem regions in ARMCI_Finalize().  ARMCI_Cleanup() too?
  * Implement locking changes corresponding to ARMCI access modes.
  * get rid of copypaste.c - re-implement armci_msg_sel? (NGA_Select_elem)
  * implement armci_read/write_strided?

Things that need performance tuning:

  * Non-blocking operations
  * Strided
  * Vector
